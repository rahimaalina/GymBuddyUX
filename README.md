The development of the GymBuddy prototype has been a valuable exercise in user-centered design. By narrowing the scope to focus on beginners, this is created in a simplified
yet effective prototype that addresses core needs, such as proper exercise form, personalized workout plans, and user motivation. The adjustments made during each iteration have improved the usability, functionality, and engagement of the system. Although the current prototype focuses on essential features, future developments could explore additional enhancements, such as the integration of optional accessories such as wristband wearable and the possibility of data interoperability, to further enrich the user experience and support long-term fitness goals. The use of wearables would
provide prospective users with a better understanding of how their exercise affects their pulse. In conclusion, GymBuddy shows how fitness plans can be revolutionized for beginners with the use of social robots to make personalized routines easily accessible and give prospective users a better understanding of the correct form and techniques to avoid injuries. This is a group project of 6 from the DTU course User Experience Engineering.
