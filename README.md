# GymBuddyUX

The development of the GymBuddy prototype has been a valu-
able exercise in user-centered design. By narrowing the
scope to focus on beginners, this is created in a simplified
yet effective prototype that addresses core needs, such as proper ex-
ercise form, personalized workout plans, and user motivation. The
adjustments made during each iteration have improved the usabil-
ity, functionality, and engagement of the system. Although the cur-
rent prototype focuses on essential features, future developments could explore additional enhancements, such as the integration
of optional accessories such as wristband wearable and the possi-
bility of data interoperability, to further enrich the user experience
and support long-term fitness goals. The use of wearables would
provide prospective users with a better understanding of how their
exercise affects their pulse. In conclusion, GymBuddy shows how
fitness plans can be revolutionized for beginners with the use of
social robots to make personalized routines easily accessible and
give prospective users a better understanding of the correct form and techniques to avoid injuries.
